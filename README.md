## ðŸ“– **Project Description**

Welcome to **Bid Project**, a straightforward bidding system created with Python! This project is aimed at beginners who want to practice basic Python concepts, particularly the use of dictionaries. Users enter their name and bid amount, and the program tracks all the bids. At the end, it identifies the highest bid and announces the winner

## ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**

- Python 3.9

## **How it Works**

1. The program collects bids from multiple users.
2. It stores the names and bid amounts in a Python dictionary.
3. Once all bids are entered, it calculates the highest bid.
4. The winner is announced!

## ðŸš€ **How to Run**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bid-project.git
   ```
2. Run the program
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Example of Terminal Output

```
    Hello! What's your name? John
    Please enter your bid amount in dollars: $ 100

    Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' if someone else wants to bid, or 'no' if you're done.
        yes

    Hello! What's your name? Alice
    Please enter your bid amount in dollars: $ 150

    Are there any other bidders? Type 'yes' if someone else wants to bid, or 'no' if you're done.
        no

    ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, Alice! You are the winner with an amazing bid of $150! ðŸŽ‰
```

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Learned

- Dictionaries in Python: This project is an excellent introduction to Python dictionaries, which store key-value pairs.
- User Input Handling: Handling user input and ensuring valid entries.
- Control Flow: Using loops and conditional statements to control the flow of the program.
